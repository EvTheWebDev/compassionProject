          Leanna said it perfectly: "This one small act has such a ripple effect. When families sit down together and share a meal, they form bonds and lasting core memories that carry into their adulthood. It's so much more than just food. It's a connection, and that's long-lasting."

        <p class="programDesc">
          A small act can spark a big change. Through the Kindness Ripple
          Program, we hand out small tokens of kindness, inviting each recipient
          to keep the ripple going by “paying it forward.” Together, we’re
          creating waves of kindness across our community.
