        <p class="lead-text">
          The Compassion Project Inc. was born from one Thanksgiving morning and
          a calling that wouldn’t quiet down.
        </p>

        <p>
          Four years ago, my family wasn’t going to be around for Thanksgiving,
          and a dear friend invited me to help prepare meals and care packages
          for people experiencing homelessness and hardship. Volunteering and
          giving back had always been a passion of mine, but that morning
          changed everything. That’s when I met <strong>Leanna</strong>. Hearing
          her story, seeing her heart, and watching her serve with such purpose
          lit something inside me. I knew I wanted to do more and that somehow,
          this was where I was meant to be.
        </p>

            <h3 class="narrative-subtitle">Finding Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          The following year, a few weeks before Thanksgiving, I felt a strong
          and unmistakable pull to do more than just show up. I launched a
          GoFundMe, shared it with friends and family, and within just five
          days, we raised $1,700 which was enough to fill my SUV with gloves,
          hats, scarves, first aid kits, hygiene items, and other essentials.
          That Thanksgiving morning, I showed up unannounced with the packed
          car, and Leanna told me she’d been heartbroken because they hadn’t
          raised enough funds for the care packages that year. She worried
          they’d be empty but as we unloaded every box, we both knew that
          calling had been for a reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next year, we set our sights higher. Our $4,000 goal became $5,600
          raised in just a few weeks and that’s when I realized this wasn’t just
          a seasonal project anymore. It was something deeper. Something that
          needed a home.

        <h3 class="narrative-subtitle">Turning Compassion Into Action</h3>
        <p>
          In the summer of 2025, I felt that same inner voice urging me to take
          the next step. I began researching how to start a nonprofit, gathering
          a small board of people who believed in the same mission, to put
          compassion into action and make a lasting impact year-round. Within
          weeks, <strong>The Compassion Project Inc.</strong> was born, and soon
          after, we received our official
          <strong>501(c)(3) determination</strong> from the IRS.
        </p>

        <div class="current-mission">
          <p>
            Our mission now goes beyond providing comfort during the holidays.
            We’re creating programs that meet immediate needs such as meals,
            clothing, care packages, and financial relief while also building
            partnerships and opportunities that strengthen our community all
            year long.

          <h3>Why We Do What We Do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Because compassion shouldn’t be limited to one day of the year.
            </li>
            <li>
              Because everyone deserves to feel seen, supported, and valued.
            </li>
            <li>
              Because sometimes, the smallest act of kindness can change
              everything.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Compassion Project exists to remind our neighbors that hope
            still lives here, and it starts with each of us.
