        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Rooted Relief Express is our mobile pantry and closet designed to meet
          people where they are. This traveling truck will deliver essential
          items, food, hygiene products, clothing, and care packages, directly
          to individuals and families across Central Indiana who are
          experiencing hardship.

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
              Many people in need face transportation and accessibility
              challenges that prevent them from reaching traditional resource
              centers. Rooted Relief Express removes those barriers by bringing
              support directly to neighborhoods, shelters, and community spaces.
              Our goal is to provide not only essentials, but also dignity,
              connection, and hope.
