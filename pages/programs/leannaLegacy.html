        <h3>About the Fund</h3>
            <p>
              The Leanna Legacy Fund was established to celebrate Leanna
              Chroman, a compassionate leader whose generosity and empathy have
              inspired countless acts of kindness, including the creation of The
              Compassion Project Inc. Through this fund, we honor her ongoing
              example of service by supporting those she has always championed:
              individuals in the hospitality industry who are facing hardship or
              striving to make a difference in their communities.
