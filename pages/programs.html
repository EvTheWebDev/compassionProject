        <p class="programDesc">
          On Thanksgiving, no one in our community should go without a warm
          meal. We prepare and share hot holiday meals for families and
          individuals facing hardship- because everyone deserves comfort,
          connection, and a full plate on this day of gratitude.

          to keep the ripple going by “paying it forward.” Together, we’re
          creating waves of kindness across our community.
