        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The Leanna Legacy Fund was established to celebrate Leanna Chroman, a
          compassionate leader whose generosity and empathy have inspired
          countless acts of kindness, including the creation of The Compassion
          Project Inc. Through this fund, we honor her ongoing example of
          service by supporting those she has always championed: individuals in
          the hospitality industry who are facing hardship or striving to make a
          difference in their communities.
